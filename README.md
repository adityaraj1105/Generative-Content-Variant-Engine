# Generative Content Variant Engine

This project demonstrates an AI-powered system that generates emotionally and tonally conditioned content variants from base templates — inspired by my internship work on personalization and creative automation.

## Features
- Emotion & tone-based prompt generation
- Template-based message variation
- Async processing with FastAPI
- Mocked MongoDB & S3 integrations

## Architecture
1. **Prompt Generation:** LLM creates text variants based on emotion-tone pairs.
2. **Image Generation (optional):** Uses a vision model to generate mood-matched visuals.
3. **Storage Layer:** Mock database (Mongo) and presigned URLs (simulated S3).
